Some Tips you could use to enhance your Windows OS performance:

    1. Open the Task Manager and navigate to the Startup menu. Then, switch to the 
       Status tab and disable any programs/utilities that you don't need to run in the background.

    2. From the search bar, search for “adjust the appearance and performance of Windows” and 
       select either “Adjust for best performance” or make your own customization.

    3. Open the Windows Settings, navigate to the System menu, choose Storage, choose “Configure storage Sense or run it now”. 
       Enable the Storage Sense and “Delete temporary files that my apps aren’t using”. 

    4. Press the window+R buttons to open the Run utility. Type “%temp” and delete all temporary files. 
       (some of them you can’t delete them, just skip them).

    5. Disable Windows Telemetry. It just sends your data to Microsoft at the cost of your system resources. To do this:
         - open the window+R buttons to open the Run utility.
         - scroll down and choose “Connected User Experiences and Telemetry”.
         - Right-click to open the properties.
         - From the startup type, change it to Disabled. 

    6. Open the CMD in admin mode and type “powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61” to enable 
       the ultimate power performance. Then, open Control Panel, search for Power Options, and select “Ultimate Performance”.

    7. Open the CMD in admin mode and type @echo off
       powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex"  This tool has a lot of futures you may go through. 
       For the performance issue, navigate to “Tweaks” menu. Select either a laptop or desktop (depending on what you’re using). 
       You will find a lot of essential and advanced options: 
         - Delete Temporary files 
         - Run disk Clean up
         - Disable Notification Tray/Celender
         - Disable Telemetry 
         - Disable Wifi-Sense
         - Set services to manual
         - After you select the required options, press “Run Tweaks” (You may select extra options if you know what they are and what they do!).
         - (Note: don’t disable/delete anything if you're not sure what it does)

    8. Open This PC/My Computer, right-click on partition C or the main partition for your OS. Select Disk Clean up, select:
         - Windows Update Cleanup 
         - Temporary Internet files
         - Delivery Optimization files
         - Device driver packages 
         - Recycle Bin (if you don’t need the deleted files)
         - Temporary files
         - Thumbnails
         - (Note: don’t disable/delete anything if you're not sure what it does)

    9. Enable the virtual memory:
         - Open This PC/My Computer
         - right-click on the space menu
         - select advanced system settings
         - in the performance section, press settings, then select advanced tab. 
         - In the Virtual memory section, select Change
         - Disable “automatically manage paging file size”
         - In the custom size button, set the initial size to (1.5 * your physical memory size). 
           For the maximum size (2 * your physical memory size).

    10. Remove any free third-party antivirus software as they consume a lot of resources constantly.
